**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the essential safety requirements for Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). These requirements are derived from international standards, regulatory guidelines, and best practices in the nuclear industry. Adherence to these requirements is crucial for ensuring the safe and reliable operation of NPPs, protecting the public and the environment from potential radiological hazards, and maintaining public confidence in nuclear power as a sustainable energy source. This document provides a broad overview and is not exhaustive; specific design and operational aspects of each NPP will necessitate further detailed requirements.

**2. Scope**

This document applies to all aspects of NPP design, construction, operation, maintenance, decommissioning, and emergency preparedness. It addresses both technical and organizational aspects, emphasizing a defense-in-depth approach to safety.
