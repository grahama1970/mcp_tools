Okay, this clarifies a lot. Based on your answers, here's a refined understanding:

*   **Error Handling:** Loguru with detailed information (file path, error message, timestamp) is the way to go. We can consider using a decorator for common error handling patterns.
> yes. But ensure that you always use the simplest approach. Do not make logging over complexty

*   **Token Counting:** Use `tiktoken` for token counting to match OpenAI's tokenizer.
> yes

*   **JSON Validation:** `json_utils.py` (provided above) handles serialization, loading, saving, parsing, and repair of JSON. We should use it as is.
> yes

*   **Embedding Batch Size:** Start with a batch size of 50 for OpenAI embeddings and concurrent processing.
> yes

*   **Sparse Checkout Failure:** If a repository fails, use Perplexity's MCP tool to attempt to find the correct link. If that also fails, log the error and continue to the next repository in the list.
> yes

*   **LiteLLM Fallback:**  We can specify any embedding model supported by LiteLLM. API keys will be stored in a `.env` file.
> yes

*   **File Size Limit:** Ignore files larger than 50KB. Log a warning when a file is skipped due to its size.
> yes

*   **Redis and ArangoDB:** Redis will be used for caching, and ArangoDB will be the primary database.
> yes. and you will be using the redis and python-arango packages

*   **CLI and FastAPI:** A Typer-based CLI and mirrored FastAPI endpoints (using sse-starlette) are required for local agent use and eventual MCP integration.
> yes. Use these files as starting points

*   **Dockerfile and Docker Compose:** A working Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` file are required for the project.

**Revised Task Plan Additions:**

Based on the clarifications, I will add the following to the task plan:

*   **Task 0.1:** Implement `.env` file loading for API keys and other configuration variables.
*   **Task 2.3:** Implement Perplexity MCP tool integration (if possible via API/library) for handling failed repository URLs during sparse checkout.
*   **Task 3.3:** Implement file size check (50KB limit) and logging for skipped files.
*   **Task 5.4:** Implement Redis caching for embedding results.
*   **Task 6.4:** Implement Redis integration in both the main pipeline and FastAPI endpoints
*   **Phase 9:** CLI Implementation: Implement a Typer-based CLI.
*   **Phase 10:** FastAPI Implementation: Implement mirrored FastAPI endpoints using sse-starlette.
*   **Phase 11:** Dockerization: Create a Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` for the project.

**Further Clarifying Questions:**

1.  **MCP Tool Access:** Do we have an API key or library access for the Perplexity MCP tool, or is the expectation to call a command line tool or scrape a webpage?

2.  **ArangoDB Schema:** Is there a pre-defined schema for the ArangoDB database, or should we define it based on the JSON structure in Phase 4? If there is a schema, could you provide details or a link to its definition?

3.  **Redis Data Structure:** How should we store the embedding results in Redis?  Key-value pairs where the key is the text being embedded and the value is the embedding vector?  What about the TTL (time-to-live) for cached embeddings?

4.  **API Endpoints:** For the FastAPI endpoints, what specific functionalities should be exposed? (e.g., single file processing, repository processing, database querying).

5.  **Typer CLI Arguments:** What arguments should the Typer CLI accept (e.g., repo URL, output directory, API key override)?

6.  **Error Reporting:** Should the summary table also log the files that the Perplexity MCP tool was used on?

I think with answers to these questions, I'll have a complete understanding of the scope and can confidently begin coding.


Crucial. All files MUST follow the below
### `.roorules`

```
# ========================================
# Global Tooling & Execution Rules
# ========================================
- Always use uv to add packages; do not use pip for installations.
- We use 'uv run' for executing python and pytest scripts. We do NOT use python directly to execute scripts.
- **Running Commands with Temporary Environment Variables:** When a task requires running a command with a specific environment variable set *only* for that command's execution (e.g., setting `MCP_TEST_BASE_URL` for pytest), **do not** rely on the simple `VAR=value command args...` syntax,recovery IS performed, **Error/Ambiguity Handling - Step 5 (Prepare for Human Debugging) is skipped** for that specific failure, as the problematic code state is discarded.

# Lesson Logging and Management (Updated)
- **Lesson Logging Rule (Add):** If you successfully employ a novel technique, pattern, or workaround, *or* if prompted by your delegator, add a concise lesson learned entry to the `lessons_learned` collection in the ArangoDB database (`doc_retriever` by default). **Use the dedicated CLI script `src/mcp_doc_retriever/lessons_cli.py add ...` via the `command` tool.** Clearly state your role in the entry. **Do not use file system tools (`write_to_file`, etc.) or direct database commands for adding lessons.** *Note: Modes `Intern Coder` and `Presenter` do not log lessons.* Custom mode instructions specify triggers for logging specific types of lessons (e.g., planning, orchestration, technical).
    - **Database Connection:** Managed via environment variables: `ARANGO_HOST`, `ARANGO_USER`, `ARANGO_PASSWORD`, `ARANGO_DB`.
    - **Collection Name:** `lessons_learned` (within the database specified by `ARANGO_DB`).
    - **Document Structure:** Similar fields to the old SQLite table (`timestamp`, `severity`, `role`, `task`, `phase`, `problem`, `solution`, `tags` (as list), `context`, `example`). Timestamp is added automatically if omitted.
    - **Preferred Tool:** `command`
    - **Preferred Command Syntax (CLI Script):** `uv run python src/mcp_doc_retriever/lessons_cli.py add --role "<ROLE>" --problem "<PROBLEM>" --solution "<SOLUTION>" [--tag "<TAG1>" --tag "<TAG2>" ...] [--severity <SEVERITY>] [--task "<TASK>"] [--phase "<PHASE>"] [--context "<CONTEXT>"] [--example "<EXAMPLE>"]` (Note: `--db-path` removed)
    - **Alternative Command Syntax:** None. Use the CLI script.
    - **Values:** Handled by the `lessons_cli.py` script and `arango_db.py` module. Tags should be provided via multiple `--tag` arguments. Text fields should be properly quoted for the shell.
    - **Environment Setup:** Ensure the ArangoDB connection environment variables are set correctly before running the command.
    - **Initialization:** The database, collection, and search view (`lessons_view`) should be initialized using `scripts/init_arangodb_lessons.py` if not already present.
- **Running Commands with Temporary Environment Variables:** When a task requires running a command with a specific environment variable set *only* for that command's execution (e.g., setting `MCP_TEST_BASE_URL` for pytest), **do not** rely on the simple `VAR=value command args...` syntax, as agent command tools may misinterpret it. **Instead, explicitly use the `env` command:**
    ```sh
    env VAR_NAME="var_value" command arg1 arg2...
    ```
  - **Example:** To run pytest targeting a local server:
    ```sh
    env MCP_TEST_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8005" uv run pytest -v -s tests/test_mcp_retriever_e2e_loguru.py
    ```
  - This ensures the variable (`MCP_TEST_BASE_URL`) is correctly set in the environment specifically for the `uv run pytest` process.

# ============================================
# General Coding & Development Principles
# ============================================
- For all Code-specific roles: Be proactive when coding. Try to fix failed tests and code. Do NOT simply report back that the tests/code failed. Iterate until you fix the code, **starting with standalone script execution (see rule below)**. Follow your protocol.
- Explain your reasoning before providing code.
- Focus on code readability and maintainability.
- Do NOT be clever. Always prefer the simplest solution that is most likely to work and is NOT brittle
- Prioritize using the most common libraries in the community.
- Always prefer official, maintained containers or packages over custom builds when available. Avoid redundant work and reduce maintenance burden by leveraging upstream expertise.

# ==============================
# Code Reuse Enforcement (NEW)
# ==============================
## Mandatory Package Check Protocol
reuse_policy:
  required_sources:
    python: ["pypi", "internal-utils>=2.3"]
    js: ["npm", "@roo/web-core"]
  check_order:
    - organization_registry
    - public_registry(pypi/npm/maven)
    - approved_vendors
  audit_frequency: weekly
  timeout: 120s
  security:
    vulnerability_scan: true
    max_cve_age: 30d

# Enhanced Coding Principles
- **Priority 1**: Use official maintained packages before considering custom code
- **Dependency Requirements**:
  - Include version constraints (e.g., Pandas==2.1.3)
  - Validate licenses using `license_checker` tool
- **Custom Code Justification**:
  - Create `reuse_exception.md` with cost-benefit analysis
  - Requires Architect approval for code >50 lines

# ==========================================
# Module Structure & Documentation Rules
# ==========================================
- Every core module file **must** include at the top:
  - A **description** of the module's purpose.
  - **Links** to third-party package documentationCrucially, properly escape any single quotes (') within these text fields by doubling them ('') for SQL compatibility.** Example: `It's important` becomes `'It''s important'`.
    - **Example SQL Insert (via sqlite3 CLI):**
        ```sh
        # --- Example values (handle quoting carefully in actual execution) ---
        ROLE='Senior Coder'
        PROBLEM='Database query failed due to incorrect JSON tag search syntax. It''s tricky.' # Escaped quote
        SOLUTION='Use LIKE ''%\"tag_name\"%'' to search for tags within the JSON array string column.' # Escaped quote
        TAGS='["sqlite", "json", "search", "sql"]' # Prepare JSON array string

        sqlite3 /app/downloads/project_state.db \
        "INSERT INTO lessons_learned (timestamp, severity, role, task, phase, problem, solution, tags, context, example) \
        VALUES (datetime('now', 'utc'), 'WARN', '${ROLE}', 'Task 1.2', 'Debugging', '${PROBLEM}', '${SOLUTION}', '${TAGS}', 'Context about the specific query', 'Example: tags LIKE ''%\"docker\"%''');"
        ```
        *(Adapt values, table/column names, and file used in the file.
  - A **sample input** and **expected output** for its main function(s).
- Every core module file **must** include a **minimal real-world usage function** (e.g., `if __name__ == "__main__":`) that verifies its core functionality independently, without Docker.
- No file should exceed **500 lines**; refactor into smaller modules if necessary.

# ====================================
# Mandatory Verification Sequence
# ====================================
- **Mandatory Post-Edit Standalone Module Verification:** For all Code-specific roles (Coders, Refactorer): **Immediately after successfully applying edits** to a primary script file (e.g., using `apply_diff`, `write_to_file`), and **before** proceeding to any other testing (like integration tests, Docker builds) or reporting completion, you **MUST** execute the modified script's `if __name__ == '__main__':` block using `uv run <filename.py>`. This standalone execution must pass without errors and verify the script's core functionality as intended by the `__main__` block (required by module structure rules). If this check fails, you must attempt to fix the code (following path. Pay close attention to SQL quoting for text fields).*

- **Lesson Updating Rule (Restricted Use):** **Updating lessons via the CLI is not currently supported.** Updates must be done directly in ArangoDB if necessary, or by adding a new, corrected lesson. If instructed (e.g., by Planner or during Debugging with human confirmation) to update a specific lesson:
    a. **Identify the `_key` or `_id`** of the lesson document to update (e.g., using `lessons-cli find` or the ArangoDB web UI).
    b. Perform the update manually or using appropriate ArangoDB tools/APIs.
- **Mandatory Post-Edit Standalone Module Verification:** For all Code-specific roles (Coders, Refactorer): **Immediately after successfully applying edits** to a primary script file (e.g., using `apply_diff`, `write_to_file`), and **before** proceeding to any other testing (like integration tests, Docker builds) or reporting completion, you **MUST** execute the modified script's `if __name__ == '__main__':` block using `uv run <filename.py>`. This standalone execution must pass without errors and verify the script's core functionality as intended by the `__main__` block (required by module structure rules). If this check fails, you must attempt to fix the code (following standard error handling procedures and the proactive fixing principle) before proceeding. Only after this standalone check *succeeds* should you consider the edit successful and move to subsequent steps or report completion.
- **New Pre-Code Validation**:
  1. Run `dependency_analyzer --file=proposal.py`
  2. Verify against `approved_packages.list`
  3. If new packages found:
 an ArangoDB update operation (e.g., using AQL `UPDATE` or `REPLACE`).
    c. Use appropriate syntax for the update method chosen.
    d. Execute using ArangoDB tools (like `arangosh`) or the `python-arango` library if scripting the update.
    - **Example AQL Update (Conceptual - adapt key/values):**
      ```aql
      UPDATE "lesson_key_here" WITH { problem: "Updated problem description." } IN lessons_learned
      ```
- **New Pre-Code Validation**:
  1. Run `dependency_analyzer --file=proposal.py`
  2. Verify against `approved_packages.list`
  3. If new packages found:
     - Submit `security_review_request.json`
     - Await Architect approval
- **Mandatory Server Readiness Verification:** For **any** agent role: **Immediately after successfully executing a command** intended to start a background web server (e.g., `uvicorn`, `gunicorn`, potentially `docker compose up -d` if testing relies on immediate API availability), and **before** proceeding with any task that relies on that server being responsive (e.g., running API tests, sending requests):
    a. **Identify Target Endpoint:** Determine the base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8005`) and a simple, reliable health-check or documentation endpoint (preferred: `/health`, fallback: `/docs` or `/openapi.json`).
    b. **Perform HTTP Polling:** Use available tools (`requests` via Python script/tool, `curl` via `command`, etc.) to repeatedly send a GET request to the target endpoint.
    c. **Polling Parameters:** Poll every **2 seconds** for a maximum of **30 seconds** (adjust timeouts as needed).
    d. **Success Condition:** Proceed **only** when a successful HTTP response (typically status code 200 OK) is received from the target endpoint.
    e. **Failure Condition:** If a successful response is not received within the timeout, the server is considered not ready. The agent **MUST** treat this as a failure of the server startup step.
    f. **Error Handling:** Handle potential connection errors during polling gracefully (e.g., log them but continue polling until timeout).
    g. **Logging:** Log the start of polling, each attempt (or status changes), and the final success or timeout result.

# ==============================================
# Standard Procedures (Consolidated from Modes)
# ==============================================
- **Error/Ambiguity Handling - Step 1 (Search Lessons Learned):**
    - **Action:** When encountering errors or ambiguity, **always query** the `lessons_learned` collection in the application's ArangoDB database first, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
    - **Tool:** Use the `command` tool with the `lessons-cli find` script.
    - **Database Connection:** Ensure ArangoDB environment variables (`ARANGO_HOST`, etc.) are set.
    - **Goal:** Find relevant past solutions or insights.
    - **Querying:**
        - Use `--keyword` for searching text fields (problem, solution, context, example).
        - Use `--tag` for filtering by exact tags.
        - Combine keywords and tags as needed.
        - Use `--limit` to control the number of results.
    - **Example CLI Search:** To find the 5 most recent lessons tagged with 'docker' OR containing 'timeout' in text fields:
        ```sh
        # Command to execute (ensure env vars are set):
        uv run python src/mcp_doc_retriever/lessons_cli.py find --keyword timeout --tag docker --limit 5
        ```
        *(Adapt keywords, tags, and limit as needed. Ensure correct shell quoting if keywords/tags contain spaces or special characters).*
    - **Outcome:** Analyze the query results. If a relevant lesson is found, apply its solution. If no relevant lesson is found, proceed to the next error handling step.

- **Error/Ambiguity Handling - Step 2 (Code Context):** If searching lessons learned yields no solution, consult relevant documentation for tasks involving code understanding, implementation, or refactoring. This includes:
   a. **Downloaded Documentation:** Check content within the relevant download directory (typically under `/app/downloads/content/` inside the container) if documentation was retrieved using the `doc_download` tool. Use `read_file` or the `doc_search` tool as appropriate.
   b. **Project Documentation:** Check any supplementary documentation stored within the project repository (e.g., in `repo_docs/`).
