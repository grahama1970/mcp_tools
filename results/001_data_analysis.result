I'll analyze this data manually:

1. Total sales: $43,800 (10,200 + 11,500 + 9,800 + 12,300)
2. Average monthly sales: $10,950 (43,800 รท 4)
3. Highest sales: April with $12,300
4. Recommendations: Focus marketing efforts on understanding April's success. Consider strategies to boost March's performance, which had the lowest sales.
